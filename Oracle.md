# Oracle specifications

## Introduction

For the purpose of these specifications, an event is a digital representation of a real world fact.
An [oracle](./Introduction.md#Oracle) is an entity that commits to publishing one or more signatures over a (number of) event outcome(s) ahead of time by releasing one or more [R-values](./Introduction.md#R-value) as well as necessary information for two parties to build a set of [CETs](./Introduction.md#Contract-Execution-Transaction-(CET)).
This necessary information is committed to in a so-called [_event descriptor_](#Event-descriptor) that will be further detailed in this document.

## Event descriptor

An event descriptor provides information to clients about an event for which an oracle plans on releasing a signature over its outcome.
The provided information should be sufficient for a client to create a set of adaptors signatures for some CETs that will cover all possible outcomes of the event.

Here we assume that an event outcome can be represented either as a set of strings or numbers.
Two kinds of event outcomes are defined (note that a single event can be composed of several types).

### Simple enumeration

For events that have a narrow range of possible outcomes, the outcomes can simply be enumerated.

#### Example: Weather tomorrow

Tomorrow's weather can be represented as the set of strings `[sunny, cloudy, rainy]`.

### Digit decomposition

When a range of a numerical outcomes is large or unbounded, the oracle can represent the outcome using digit decomposition.

The event descriptor should include:

- base: a number representing the base in which the outcome value is decomposed and which will indicate the possible range of each digit that will be signed (e.g. 2 for binary, 10 for decimal, 16 for hex-decimal).
- is-signed: a boolean value indicating whether the outcomes can be negative.
- unit: the unit of the outcome value
- precision: the precision of the outcome representing the base exponent by which to multiply the number represented by the composition of the digits to obtain the actual outcome value.
- number of digits: the number of digits that the oracle will sign (if `is-signed` is set to true, the number of R-values for the event will be `number of digits + 1`).

In the case where the number of digits that make up the outcome value exceeds the number of r-values that the oracle committed to, the oracle should sign the maximal possible value that it can attest to.
In the case where the outcome value became negative but the oracle did not provide an extra R-value, it should sign the value 0.
The minimum and maximum values that can be attested to by an oracle should thus be interpreted as `max_value or more` and `min_value or less`.
This enables contracting party to specify payouts for the overflow and underflow cases, and avoid having to use the refund path which in most cases would be unfair.<sup id="foot1">[1](#f1)</sup>

The oracle must separately provide an array of R values, one for each of the digit that will be signed, with the first value of the array being used for signing the leftmost digit. If the is-signed value is true, an additional R-value must be provided as the first element in this array, which will be used to sign the string "+" in case of an outcome with a positive value or zero value and the string "-" in case of an outcome with a negative one.
In practice this array is provided as part of the [Oracle events](#Oracle-events) structure.

When the outcome is not the same order of magnitude as the maximum possible outcome, leading zeros must be signed.

#### Example: BTC/USD rate

The following example illustrates how numerical decomposition can help reduce the number of required CETs while covering a large range of possible outcomes.

Alice and Bob wish to enter into a DLC at time `t` when BTC/USD ~= $10000 with a maturity time of `t+1`.
The oracle provides 6 R-values `R0-5`, meaning that it will sign six digits `D0-5`, enabling him to attest to outcomes in the range `[000000,999999]`:

```
base: 10
isSigned: false
RValues: [R0, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5]
unit: dollars
precision: 0
```

Alice and Bob create a DLC with "relevant" outcomes between $10000 and $10999.
Below $10000 Alice gets everything, and above $10999 Bob gets everything.
They use the `R0` and `R1` values to cover the cases where BTC/USD < $10000 using `D0=0` and `D1=0`.
They use `R0`, `R1` and `R2` to cover the cases where BTC/USD > $10999 and <= $19999, using `D1=0`, `D1=1` and `D2 in [0-9]`.
They use `R0` and `R1` to cover the cases where BTC/USD >= $20000 and < $99999, using `D0=0` and `D1 in [2,9]`.
Finally, they use only `D0` to cover the cases where BTC/USD >= $100000 and <= $999999, using `D0 in [1-9]`.

At maturity time, if the BTC/USD rate is less than $999999, the oracle signs each of the digits representing the outcome value using the digits' corresponding R value.
For example, if the rate at maturity time is $20000, the oracle will sign the digits `0`, `2`, `0`, `0`, `0`, `0`.

If the rate is greater than $999999, the oracle signs the digits `9`, `9`, `9`, `9`, `9`, `9`.

### Serialization and signing of outcome values

Every outcome value should be encoded as [a UTF-8 string with NFC normalization](./Messaging.md#Fundamental-types), before being passed to the signing algorithm.
UTF-8 is chosen as being a widely supported and easy to implement encoding format.

For numerical outcomes represented in bases greater than 10, each digit should be converted to base 10 before being encoded (note that base 10 numbers in UTF-8 take values in the 0x0030-0x0039 range).
This helps preventing any confusion about the capitalization of letters or the introduction of non-standard characters.

Signing should be done using the [signing algorithm](#Signing-Algorithm) using the tag `attestation/v0`.

### Serialization of event descriptors

Event descriptors should be serialized using [TLV format](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/01-messaging.md#type-length-value-format) as described bellow.

#### Version 0 `enum_event_descriptor`

1. type: 55302 (`enum_event_descriptor_v0`)
2. data:
   * [`u16`:`num_outcomes`]
   * [`string`:`outcome_1`]
   * ...
   * [`string`:`outcome_n`]

This type of event descriptor is a simple enumeration where the value `n` is the number of outcomes in the event.

Note that `outcome_i` is the outcome value itself and not its hash that will be signed by the oracle.

#### Version 0 `digit_decomposition_event_descriptor`

1. type: 55306 (`digit_decomposition_event_descriptor_v0`)
2. data:
   * [`bigsize`:`base`]
   * [`bool`:`is_signed`]
   * [`string`:`unit`]
   * [`int32`:`precision`]
   * [`u16`:`nb_digits`]

### Oracle events

For users to be able to create DLCs based on a given event, they also need to obtain information about the oracle and the time at which it plans on releasing a signature over the event outcome.
Oracle events contain such information, which includes:
* the nonce(s) that will be used to sign the event outcome(s)
* the earliest time (UTC) at which it plans on releasing a signature over the event outcome, in epoch seconds,
* the event descriptor,
* the event ID which can be a name or categorization associated with the event by the oracle.

The TLV serialization for oracle events is as follow:

#### Version 0 `oracle_event`

1. type: 55330 (`oracle_event_v0`)
2. data:
   * [`u16`:`nb_nonces`]
   * [`nb_nonces*x_point`:`oracle_nonces`]
   * [`u32`:`event_maturity_epoch`]
   * [`event_descriptor`:`event_descriptor`]
   * [`string`:`event_id`]

## Oracle announcements

In order to make it possible to hold oracles accountable in cases where they do not release a signature for an event outcome, there needs to be a proof that an oracle has committed to a given outcome.
This proof is given in a so-called oracle announcement, which contains an oracle event together with the oracle public key and a signature over its serialization, which must be valid with respect to the specified public key.

This also makes it possible for users to obtain oracle event information from an un-trusted peer while being guaranteed that it originates from a given oracle.

The TLV serialization of oracle announcements is as follow.

#### Version 0 `oracle_announcement`

1. type: 55332 (`oracle_announcement`)
2. data:
   * [`signature`:`annoucement_signature`]
   * [`x_point`:`oracle_public_key`]
   * [`oracle_event`:`oracle_event`]

where `signature` is a Schnorr signature over a sha256 hash of the serialized `oracle_event`, using the tag `announcement/v0`.

## Oracle Attestations

After an event occurs, and the oracle creates signatures to attest the outcome, it needs to give them to users.
An oracle can use an attestation tlv to give users this information.

The TLV serialization of oracle attestations is as follows.

#### Version 0 `oracle_attestation`

1. type: 55400 (`oracle_attestation_v0`)
2. data:
    * [`string`:`event_id`]
    * [`x_point`:`oracle_public_key`]
    * [`u16`: `nb_signatures`]
    * [`signature`:`signature_1`]
    * ...
    * [`signature`:`signature_n`]
    * [`string`:`outcome_1`]
    * ...
    * [`string`:`outcome_n`]

Where the signatures are ordered the same as the nonces in their original `oracle_event`.
The outcomes should be the message signed, ordered the same as the signatures.

## Signing Algorithm

Signatures should be generated following the algorithm specified in [BIP 340](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0340.mediawiki).
Tagged hashes should also be used as defined in the [design section of BIP 340](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0340.mediawiki#Design).

The secret key (`sk`) should be the private key corresponding to the oracle's public key.

The algorithm `Sign(sk, message, tag)` is defined as:

* Let H = `tag_hash("DLC/oracle/" || tag)`
* Let `m` = H(`message`)
* Return `BIP340_sign(sk, m)`

## Footnotes

<b id="f1">1</b>: More complex constructions where considered to handle these.
For example, one considered approach was to require the oracle to sign the number of digit that make up an outcome.
Another one was to sign a flag indicating overflow.
However, these make the specifications more complex, without providing any clear benefit (or without the currently specified approach having any clear downside).
